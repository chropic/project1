# Architecture

All agents must read [PONYTAIL.md](PONYTAIL.md) before planning changes and again before every commit. Use its philosophy when making architecture decisions: understand the affected flow, reuse existing capabilities, and choose the smallest correct change. See the [Repository guide](../AGENTS.md) for the required workflow.

## Shape

```text
Internet → Cloudflare Access → Cloudflare Tunnel → 127.0.0.1:19283 → Compose container → server.js
```

The service is deliberately stateless. Its only success response is `Hello, world!\n` as `text/plain` for `GET /`.

## Landmarks

| Location | Purpose | Change carefully when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [docs/PONYTAIL.md](PONYTAIL.md) | Verbatim development philosophy; required reading before planning and committing | Preserve unchanged; put repository-specific guidance in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) |
| [server.js](../server.js) | HTTPS server, validation, headers, timeouts, rate limiting | Changing request behavior or security controls |
| [dev.js](../dev.js) | Local development entry point with automatic certificates and loopback binding | Changing developer setup; reuses `createServer` |
| [compose.yaml](../compose.yaml) | Local-only port publishing, certificate mount, runtime restrictions | Changing deployment or resource limits |
| [Dockerfile](../Dockerfile) | Minimal unprivileged Node runtime image | Changing the runtime or build inputs |
| [package.json](../package.json) | Commands and release version | Releasing or adding a development command |
| [test/configuration.test.js](../test/configuration.test.js) | Endpoint and host-validation checks | Changing server behavior |

## Request contract

```text
TLS 1.2+ request
  ├─ known Host?            no → 421
  ├─ below rate limit?      no → 429
  ├─ GET?                  no → 405
  ├─ exact path /?         no → 404
  ├─ empty body?           no → 413
  └─ return plaintext      yes → 200
```

`server.js` does not trust forwarded client-IP headers. Its local rate limit uses the direct socket address, which is intentional: Cloudflare Access and the tunnel/firewall enforce the real network boundary.

## Security invariants

- TLS key and certificate paths are mandatory at startup.
- `ALLOWED_HOSTS` is mandatory and exact-match only.
- No cookies, CORS, HTML, JavaScript, request parsing, storage, logging of requests, or dependencies exist.
- The service rejects bodies and transfer encodings, caps header size/count and keep-alive work, and returns only plaintext errors.

Preserve these invariants unless the change is explicitly approved and documented in this file and `CHANGELOG.md`.
